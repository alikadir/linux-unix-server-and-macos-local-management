# Linux / Unix (MacOS) and Server Management

Unix and Linux are both operating systems, but there are some key differences between them.

| Feature            | Unix                             | Linux                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| License            | Proprietary                      | Open source                                           |
| Cost               | Paid                             | Free                                                  |
| Distribution       | Distributed by various companies | Distributed by many different communities             |
| Compatibility      | POSIX compliant                  | Many distributions are POSIX compliant                |
| File system        | Various file systems             | Various file systems, but most distributions use ext4 |
| Commercial support | Yes                              | Yes, but limited                                      |
| Community support  | Smaller community                | Large and active community                            |

Remember that while there are these differences, there are also many similarities due to Linux's Unix-like nature. Many skills and knowledge transfer between the two
